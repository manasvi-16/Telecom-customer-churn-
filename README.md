# Telecom-customer-churn 
## Aim 
The aim of this project is to solve the classification problem in the telecom customer churn dataset using decision tree classifier, support vector classifier, random forest classifier, etc.

## Dataset 
The dataset is taken from kaggle which is a combination of textual as well as integer data. The Customer Churn table contains information on all 7,043 customers from a Telecommunications company in California in Q2 2022.
